# sha1_collision_hunter

Hunts for a pair of strings whose sha1 digests start with the same x hex characters.

Preset to hash 9 character long strings of letters, uppercase and lowercase. Hunting for 15 character overlaps.
(This will take a while, took me 6.33 billion hashes to find my first pair, over around 9 hours) 

Created as part of an assignment for my Network Security and Cryptography module at University of Birmingham.

I'll clean up the code eventually! :)
